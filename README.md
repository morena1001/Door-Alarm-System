# Door-Alarm-System

10 buttons to represent number pad, another button to lock or unlock system, another to reset password.

To lock system, simply press the lock button. A timer will countdown, signaled by the passive buzzer, to allow the user to leave the room and lock the door properly. To unlock system, the password must be inputted, then the unlock button must bre pressed.

To reset password, the reset password button must be pressed, then the previous password must be inputted, and then the new password must be inputted.

The system will have a passive buzzer that will make a sound on input, like the number pad and the other 2 buttons. It will also make a short beep if the door is opened while the system is unlocked, will sound once a second for 10 seconds when the alarm is first set, and will sound if the door is opened while the system is locked. 

Will need 10 number keypad to turn off or set alarm. Need another button to confirm off / on of alarm. LCD screen to visualize what is happening. Will need IR communication module connected to seperate breadboards to determine when the door has been opened.
